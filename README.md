## Features

- Add configured border;
- Inner gradient available;

## Usage
Import the library into Android Studio or add dependency in build.gradle

    compile 'com.github.avenwu:IndexImageView:1.0.1'

Most attributes of IndexImageView can be configured through xml;
    
    <com.github.avenwu.imageview.IndexImageView
        android:layout_width="100dp"
        android:layout_height="100dp"
        android:src="@drawable/image1"
        android:scaleType="centerCrop"
        app:indexText="100"
        app:indexFontSize="20sp"
        app:indexBackground="#ff5722"
        app:gradientEnable="false"
        app:circleBackground="#cddc39"
        app:strokeColor="#259b24" />
		
However you can also make new instance dynamically;

    IndexImageView imageView = new IndexImageView(this);
    imageView.setImageResource(R.drawable.image1);
    imageView.setIndexEnable(true);
    imageView.setText("121");
    
For more detail please look into the sample app;
